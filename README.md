# RBP-TSTL is a two-stage transfer learning framework for genome-scale prediction of RNA-binding proteins
## Introduction

<!-- RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) form ribonucleoprotein complexes when binding with RNAs. They play crucial roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of RNAs and are potential biological markers for cancer diagnosis [1-5]. The wet-lab experimental methods, such as RNA Interactome Capture (RIC) [6], can accurately identify RBPs. However, these approaches are time-consuming and cost-intensive, which are not suitable for high-throughput identification of RBPs [7]. In addition, RIC can only work on RBPs with functional poly(A) tails on transcripts and efficient incorporation of cross-link-enhancing artificial nucleotides [8], thereby limiting its application to RBPs in prokaryotes. In this context, computational approaches for in silico high-throughput prediction of RBPs can help guide hypothesis-driven experimental studies of RBPs. To date, a variety of computational methods have been developed for this purpose. These methods can be generally classified into two major groups: template-based and machine learning-based.

# Steps for implementing the code:
1. Download the embeddings generated by self-supervised pre-trained language model and the RBPs datasets from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18nCJNhuC_v0GuvxgztJ6YDPKq3wH3YhD?usp=sharing, https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T_PGS3Ake0HGG7S4A4nopcJY5ieQur_4?usp=sharing
2. run the code 
```
python train.py     --pro_label_dir 'pretrain_accending_trP2392_trN38582_VaP292_VaN4881_TeP298_TeN4889_pep_label.csv'   \ 
                          --rep_dir     'prot_t5_xl_uniref50_pretrain.csv'    \
